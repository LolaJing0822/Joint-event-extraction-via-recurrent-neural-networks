----------------

There are two steps to run this code:

* Preprocessing: using file ```jee_processData.py```

You will need to have the ACE 2005 data set in the format required by this file.
We cannot include the data in this release due to licence issues. A sample document is provided in ```data```.

* Train and test the model: using file ```evaluateJEE.py```

This step takes the output file in step 1.

There are various parameters of the model you can change directly in the ```evaluateJEE.py``` file.
